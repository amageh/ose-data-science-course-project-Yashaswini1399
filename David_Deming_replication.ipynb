    "David Deming (2017) examines the changing structure and the trends in the labor market from the 1990s and the 2000s to explain the evolving role of social skills in the labor market. \n",
    "An important idea in the literature on labor economics has been that of skill biased technological change, i.e. explaining increasing returns to skill through the existence of complementarity between skilled labor and technological change. Thus, in the 1990s the labor market was \"hollowed out\" as technological change substituted routine tasks and complemented skilled labor.\n",
    "As Deming notes, however, starting in the 2000s, there has been very little growth in high paying and cognitive skill intensive jobs, which begs the question that if technological change is skill biased, why have returns stagnated? Two possible explanations are offered; that there are technological \"cycles\" which boom and bust and there is currently a slowdown in technological progress, while the other is that the definition of what is considered routine is expanding and so computer capital is substituting for labor even higher up in the skill distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deming also notes however that the relative decline in high skilled employment in the 2000s has been driven by STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) jobs. STEM jobs shrank by 0.12 percentage points as a share of the U.S. labor force between 2000 and 2012 as opposed to rising by 1.33 percentage points in the previous two decades, while all other cognitive occupations grew by 2.87 percentage points between 2000 and 2012 (against a growth of 1.99 percentage points in the previous decade). He further notes that the fastest growing cognitive occupations- managers, teachers, nurses, lawyers etc. all involve a considerable amount of interpersonal interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper, the author shows that high return jobs increasingly require social skills, which are generally difficult to automate and substitute. Deming presents a model of team production between workers, who perform a variety of tasks on the job, productivity in which is determined by the cognitive skills, while the ability to \"trade\" tasks with other workers is determined by their social skills. I provide an alternative model, which determines returns to social skills by using the concept of \"collaborative networks\", where workers have social networks that they utilize to collaborate on tasks and thus, increase their productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictions of Deming's model are then investigated using the data from National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and 1999 (NLSY79 and NLSY99) and the Occupational Information Network (O* NET). \n",
    "\n",
    "An important prediction of Deming's model is that workers with high social skills will self select into more non-routine occupations. While Deming carries out this analysis for workers of different occupations, which include freelance workers, no separate analysis is carried out for business owners and self-employed workers or \"entreprenuers\", occupations which by their very nature are very non-routine. I extend Deming's analysis to explicitly include entrepreneurs and examine how different aspects such as the scale of the enterprise are affected by increased social skills of the owner. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook proceeds as follows. In Section 2, I present the basic structure of the model presented by the author that lays down the theoretical framework for the paper, in addition to an alternative model I develop. In Section 3, I discuss the data used and in Section 4 I analyze the identification strategy used by the author. Section 5 shows my replication of the results in the paper and in Section 6 I extend Deming's analysis to include business owners and the self-employed. Section 7 offers some concluding remarks."

    "\n",
    "In this section, I present the structure of Deming's theoretical model and it's predictions that underlie the author's empirical analysis in the paper. I only present the basic setup and structure of the model, details of which can be found in Deming's paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deming extends the standard human capital model of labor supply to incorporate a \"task framework\":\n",
    "                                $$ y_j(i)= A_j\\alpha_j(i)l_j(i) $$  \n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_j(i)$ specifies the production function for task i as worker j's cognitive skill $A_j$ times a task productivity parameter $\\alpha_j(i)$ times labor supplied to task i. Any job can be separated into an infinite number of discrete tasks that are jointly performed to produce some good. Deming assumes that workers perform a continuum of tasks according to the following:\n",
    "$$ Y_j= exp[\\int_{0}^{1}lny_j(i)di] $$\n",
    "and that each worker supplies one unit of labor inelastically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deming points out that this setup allows two workers with the same level of cognitive ability to differ in terms of productivity over individual tasks, which implies that workers can specialize in performing those tasks over which they have a comparative advantage. Deming's model thus develops from the Ricardian trade framework, where instead of countries producing products over which they have a comparative advantage, workers \"trade tasks\" for mutual benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "He argues that social skills matter because they reduce the costs of task trading with fellow workers. He formalizes this by introducing a depreciation factor $S_{i,n} \\in (0,1)$ that is proportionaly applied to any task trade where $S_{i,n}= S_i*S_n$ for $i \\neq n$ and each worker can trade costlessly with themselves, i.e. $S_{i,i}=1 \\forall  i$. Workers with high social skill therefore pay a lower coordination cost to trade with others, which allows them to earn higher wages by specialzing in the tasks they can perform best and trading their output with others. Workers with high cognitive ability but low social skill will perform an inefficient number of tasks by themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is clear on when social skills will matter; if there is a high variance in the task productivity factors, there is greater gain from trading tasks while if there is low variance (in the limiting case $\\alpha_j(i)$ takes the same value for all tasks), then there are no gains from trade and only the cognitive ability matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deming considers a competitive market where Y is the only final good, defined as above and labor is the only factor of production. Firms hire pairs of workers and pay market wages equal to $Y_j$ times exogenous output price $P^{*}$. Workers maximize output $Y_j$ and firms maximize profits as total revenue $P^*(Y_1 +Y_2)$ minus wages paid to workers $(w_1 + w_2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "I now look at the case where Deming characterizes equilibrium with social skills, presenting a brief verbal explanation of the formal argument, which can be found in Deming's paper. With only two workers, worker one will produce tasks on their own rather than trading if worker specific task price in terms of efficiency units of labor if produced on her own is less than the task price if produced by the other worker. This leads to the division of the task interval where certain tasks are performed exclusively by worker 1, others are performed exclusively by worker 2 and the remaining tasks are non-traded.\n",
    "The equilibrium wages are given by:\n",
    "$$ w_1= P* A_1^{i^H}(S*A_2\\omega)^{1-i^H}exp[\\int_0^{i^H} ln\\alpha_1(i)di + \\int_{i^H}^1 ln\\alpha_2(i)di]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ w_2= P* A_2^{1-i^L}(S*A_1\\omega^{-1})^{i^L}exp[\\int_0^{i^L} ln\\alpha_1(i)di + \\int_{i^L}^1 ln\\alpha_2(i)di]$$\n"

    "2. Cognitive skill and social skill are complements: This can be seen as the second derivatives of $w_1$ and $w_2$ with respect to A and S* are positive; intuitively, social skills are more valuable when cognitive ability is high because more value can be traded by the worker.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2.2 Extension: An Alternative model with Collaborative Networks <a id=\"Extension_model\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The model specified by Deming incorporates social skills by using the concept of task trade. However, it is not always intuitive that people can \"trade tasks\" with others in their jobs, for example it is difficult to imagine physicians, lawyers, teachers etc. trading tasks with others. It is easier to recognize the presence of what I call \"collaborative networks\", i.e. social networks of workers which they can access to produce better work or perform their jobs better. For example, a lawyer might have a network of other lawyers, whom she can consult for help with a specific case. The same holds true for physicians, economists etc. This is especially clear in customer-oriented jobs where client networks are extremely important and a business owner/ an entrepreneur usually builds and utilizes these client networks to enhance their production. Therefore, I provide below a simple alternative model for returns to social skills using \"collaborative networks\", inspired by Calvó-Armengol and Jackson's networked model of employment. Although social skills are undoubtedly essential in even the building of social networks, here I consider a case where social skills are used in the effective utilization of existing social networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "I note here that Deming clarifies his position on the above by stating that instead of considering teamwork in production, one can consider customer-oriented jobs like consulting, health, teaching etc. as a joint production ventures between the workers and the customers. So, the model I provide is just a simple alternative way of looking at the same problem."

    "\n",
    "I utilize the same initial setup as Deming. Good Y is produced by performing a continuum of tasks, i.e.:\n",
    "$$ Y_j= exp[\\int_{0}^{1}lny_j(i)di] $$\n",
    "and each worker supplies one unit of labor inelastically, i.e.\n",
    "$$ \\int_{0}^{1}l_j(i) di = L_j =1 $$\n",

    "\n",
    "where $y_j(i)$ specifies the production function for task i as worker j's cognitive skill $A_j$ times a task productivity parameter $\\alpha_j(i)$ times labor supplied to task i.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, here I consider worker networks that are established within a firm. Assume there are n workers connected by an undirected network, which is represented by an $n \\times n$ symmetric matrix G, whose entries are {0,1}. Thus, if an entry $G_{kl}$ is 0, that means that workers k and l are not connected in the network and they are connected if the value is 1. Each worker has a social skill level $S_j$. As social skills increase, the probability that a worker will be able to utilize his network to increase his task productivity rises. Thus, I model $\\alpha_j(i)$ as follows:\n",
    "$$ \\alpha_j(i)= \\sum_{k=1}^{n}p_j^k(S_j)\\beta_j^k(i) $$\n",
    "where $p_j^k(S_j)$ is the probability that worker j will collaborate with worker k and $\\beta_j^k(i)$ is the enhancement in task productivity of worker j by collaborating with worker k. \n",

    "\n",
    "To determine the wage $w_j$ I then follow a similar analysis as in Deming's model. I characterize the wage received by worker j for task i as $p_j(i)$, which is equal to the wage paid to worker j for a unit of labor divided by the quantity of task i that can be produced by worker j with a unit of labor:\n",

    "Years of education and type of occupation are directly observable. Experience is proxied by age and following many other authors (Neal and Johnson 1996; Altonji, Bharadwaj and Lange 2012), cognitive ability is captured by the AFQT score. Non-cognitive skills are proxied by the Rotter Locus of Control and Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale (as in Heckman, Stixrud and Uruza 2006). \n",
    "Similar to Heckman, Stixrud and Uruzua (2006), the equation for each outcome variable (ln(wage) or occupation type) to be estimated is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Y_i = \\beta_{Yi}X_Y + \\alpha_{Yi}Cognitive + \\gamma_{Yi}Non-cognitive + \\delta_{Yi}Social-skills + \\epsilon_{Yi} $$\n",
    "where X includes all control variables like schooling, experience, race, gender etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Heckman, Stixrud and Uruza (2006) point out, schooling is itself an endogenous variable that is affected by ability. Additionally, they also highlight that the cognitive and non-cognitive abilites as measured by the AFQT and the Rotter and Rosenberg scores are affected by years of schooling, creating a reverse causality problem, where higher ability can increase earning and at the same time higher schooling can cause both higher ability scores and higher wages. Thus, a regression is likely to overstate the cognitive and non-cognitive ability coefficients and understate the schooling coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are however, two concerns that can be raised here about establishing the causal effect of social skills on the dependent variables discussed.\n",
    "The first, as Deming highlights, is that it could be that wages are determined by a single underlying ability that is measured by all three skills (social, cognitive, non-cognitive) with error. In that case, the effect of social skills on wages and other outcomes would also be overestimated. But, as shown in Table 1 of the results section, this does not turn out to be the case.\n",
    "The second is that it could be that there exists some reverse causality between schooling and social skills, just as for cognitve and non-cognitive ability. There is however, a priori no reason to believe that social skills affect or are affected by formal schooling after age (or experience) effects are taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence a least squares regression of the outcome variables on social skills, controlling for all other relevant variables can be used to examine the returns to social skills."

Moreover, social skills task inputs steadily grew at about 2% through the 2000s. \n",

On the other hand, a one standard deviation increase in social skills is associated with only about 0.6 percentage point increase in employment probability in NLSY79 vs a 3 percentage point increase in NLSY97.

For social skills however, column (4) implies that one standard deviation increase led to a wage gain of about 2% in NLSY79 vs a wage gain of 3.7% in NLSY97.

    "While there are many theories of entrepreneurship and self-employment, from the Schumpeterian view of an entrepreneur as a harbinger of change and innovation to Knight's view of an entrepreneur as a bearer of costs of uncertainty, to Baumol's extension of Schumpeterian typology to productive, unproductive and destructive entrepreneurship; there can be no doubt about the fact that business owners and entrepreneurs must perform a wide variety of tasks such as financing (the scale of which is apparent by the number of financing products available in the markets from venture capital to small business loans), hiring workers, establishing client networks etc. Even those self-employed people who work as freelancers need to organize, manage and advertise their operation, although the scale might be smaller when compared to business owners.\n",

    "One of the main predictions of Deming's model was that workers with high social skills will sort into non-routine occupations which require high social skills. For the reasons mentioned above, I test this hypothesis for business owners and the self-employed using the following estimation equation:\n",

    "$$ Business_{ijt} = \\alpha + \\beta_1COG_{i} + \\beta_2SS_{i} + \\beta_3COG_{i}*SS_{i} + \\gamma X_{ijt} + \\delta_j + \\zeta_t + \\epsilon_{ijt} $$\n",

    "where $Business_{ijt}$ is an indicator variable for whether the person is self-employed or owns a business conditional on full-time employment. The baseline model is again identical to the one in section 5.1.1, with additional controls for years of completed education. The results are presented in Table 5."

    "It is important here to again take note of the fact that differences in data collection strategy and the years for which the data was available makes a comparison of the two results impossible. One, in the NLSY79 dataset, the question posed was whether the person was a business owner while in the NLSY97 dataset the question was whether the individual was self-employed, which potentially includes freelance workers who are not business owners. \n",
    "Secondly, a very important caveat is that the data for NLSY79 was only available from 2010, making the individuals in the NLSY79 dataset over 40 years of age at the time of survey while those in the NLSY97 belong to a much younger age group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inclusion of all kinds of self-employed people and not just business owners could potentially explain the difference in returns to both cognitive and social skill, but more importantly, the mean age of those in the NLSY79 sample is 49 while the mean age of those in the NLSY97 is 24, which suggests that those in the NLSY97 sample would have only just entered the labor market with which large labor market frictions are associated, specifically for entrepreneurs and the self-employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even without a comparison of changes over time however, we can conclude that Deming's prediction holds up in this case as well, as individuals with high social skills sort into non-routine occupations such as business ownership."

    "The results from table 6 show that there is again a divergence in the results obtained from the two datasets. For NLSY97, a one standard deviation increase in social skills increases the scale of business in terms of employees hired by around 12 employees. The p-value of the coefficient is close to 5% and is significant at the 10% level, while the coefficient of social skills for NLSY79 is insignificant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this apparent divergence in the results is difficult to explain without additional data, given the differences in the datasets. One conjecture might be that given the age differences in the two samples, the older business owners (from the NLSY79 dataset) have had a lot more time to establish their business, so returns to social skill have faded out, while for younger entrepreneurs starting out, the returns to social skill are more potent in terms of establishing the scale of their business. While intuitive on some level, this is just a conjecture; comparison of the results from the two datasets cannot be done without the availability of more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, I find that the results here are mixed; there is possibly a positive impact of social skills on the scale of a business as measured by number of employees, as evidenced by the NLSY97 results, but the result is not fully convincing given the lack of data."

    "Further, I presented empirical findings on the role of social skills in the occupational sorting of individuals into self-employed and non self-employed, along with presenting results for impact of social skills on the scale of a business.\n",
    "Inclusion of additional data which ensures comparability across the NLSY surveys can lead to stronger results for these extensions.\n",

    "Undoubtedly, the evidence from Deming's paper is substantive to argue for the case of increasing importance of social skills over time and my extensions have only buttressed Deming's findings. Further research on the role of how social skills evolve and develop can shed more light on the subject at hand."
